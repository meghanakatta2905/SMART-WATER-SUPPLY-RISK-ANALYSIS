This project focuses on implementing a smart risk analysis system for water supply networks. It aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of drinking water distribution through early warning mechanisms and predictive modeling.
Features:
Real-time monitoring of water quality parameters
Predictive modeling for chlorine residuals in distribution systems
Risk assessment for bacterial contamination and disinfection by-products (DBPs)
Automated alerts for potential water quality issues
Data-driven decision support for water treatment operations
